# 5. Full suite (unit + integration) from test worktree against live server
# NOTE: pyproject.toml's addopts bakes in `-m "not integration"`, which silently
# wins over a bare `pytest tests/ -q` — must override the marker expression
# explicitly or integration tests never actually run despite this being the
# "full suite" step. (Discovered 2026-07-05: every prior /deploy run had been
# silently skipping all integration tests while reporting success.)
#
# Run unit and integration as two SEPARATE sequential invocations rather than
# one combined `-m "integration or not integration"` run — measured 2026-07-05:
# combined run took ~62s and intermittently failed a timing-sensitive perf
# test (-n auto oversubscribing across both suites at once); two sequential
# runs took ~40s total and didn't reproduce the flake.
